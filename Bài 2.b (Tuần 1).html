            <li> 4 stars I loved the buttery taste of the crust which complements the apples very nicely. -- Reviewed on Sep.22.2010 by MMASON </li>
            <li> Nothing special. I like the crust, but there was a little too much of it for my taste, and I liked the filling but there was too little of it. I thought the crunchy apples combined with the sliced almonds detracted from the overall flavor. -- Reviewed on Sep.1.2010 by GLENDACHEF.</li>
            <li> Delicious!! I recommend macrowaving the apples for 3 minutes before baking to soften them. Great dessert - I'll be making it again for holidays. -- Reviewed on August 28, 2010 by GLENDACHEF. </li>
